#Resume-s
This is a project created for the 2015 integrate hackathon

##About
Our product allows recruiters to upload photos which contains the candidate's resume and face, to our app. We start by uploading files from the recruiters computer or phone using HP's Object Store API. We use HP's optical character recognition API and the facial recognition API through object references to save the text from the resume and the image of candidates face. After which we allow recruiters to search, using HP's query index API, for potential candidates based on particular skill or experience and we show the result of candidates who have mentioned the specific skills in their resumes.
